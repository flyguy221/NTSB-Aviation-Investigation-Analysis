The incorrect wiring caused the antiskid system not to function as intended, resulting in the failure of the left outboard tire and a significant loss of the airplane’s braking ability, which led to the runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were (1) Saab’s design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration’s lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers’ inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturer’s limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir’s failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir’s route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane.","Personnel issues - Task performance - Maintenance - Scheduled/routine maintenance - Other, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Main landing gear - Incorrect service/maintenance, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - (general) - Attain/maintain not possible, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Decision making/judgment - Pilot, Environmental issues - Conditions/weather/phenomena - Wind - Tailwind - Decision related to condition, Organizational issues - Development - Design - Equipment design - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Land gear sys wiring - Design, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - (general) - Operator, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - FAA/Regulator, Environmental issues - Operating environment - Airport facilities/design - (general) - Decision related to condition",,"53.898333999999998","-166.54417000000001","Saab","2000","AIR","PADU","Unalaska","false","2","TP","SCHD",,"121","Substantial","VMC","Peninsula AviationServices Inc.,","Landing","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100437","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA20MA002.aspx"

Contributing to the accident was the captain's failure to adequately monitor the airplane's flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industry's selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officer's aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to implement the pilot records database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.","Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Documentation/record keeping - Personnel records - Not specified, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Documentation/record keeping - Personnel records - FAA/Regulator, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Auto flight system - (general) - Unintentional use/operation, Personnel issues - Experience/knowledge - Experience/qualifications - Qualification/certification - Copilot, Personnel issues - Psychological - Perception/orientation/illusion - (general) - Copilot, Personnel issues - Experience/knowledge - (general) - (general) - Copilot, Personnel issues - Psychological - Attention/monitoring - Attention - Pilot, Personnel issues - Psychological - Personality/attitude - Personality - Copilot, Personnel issues - Task performance - Use of equip/info - Use of automation - Copilot, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Action - Incorrect action performance - Copilot, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Indicating/recording systems - Data recorders (flight/maint) - Design, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Auto flight system - (general) - Design",,"29.77","-94.660003000000003","Boeing","767","AIR","KIAH","George Bush Intercontinental","false","2","TF","NSCH",,"121","Destroyed","IMC","Atlas Air","Enroute","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=99013","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA19MA086.aspx"

Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties.  Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots.  Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.",,,"41.780338","-87.770270999999994","Boeing","737-700","AIR","MDW","Midway Airport","false","2","TF","SCHD",,"121","Substantial","IMC",,,"Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=62926","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA06MA009.aspx"

Contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing only the airport approach lights. The pilots' unprofessional behavior during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.

the inability of the captain, because of his use of monovision contact lenses, to overcome his misperception of the airplane's position relative to the runway during the visual portion of the approach. This misperception occurred because of visual illusions produced by the approach over water in limited light conditions, the absence of visible ground features, the rain and fog, and the irregular spacing of the runway lights. Contributing to the accident was the lack of instantaneous vertical speed information available to the pilot not flying, and the incomplete guidance available to optometrists, aviation medical examiners, and pilots regarding the prescription of unapproved monovision contact lenses for use by pilots.
